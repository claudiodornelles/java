This is an implementation of the BubbleSort algorithm, and it is part of my studies of Data Structures and algorithms using Java.

BubbleSort algorithm is an in-place algorithm, meaning that it does not create new arrays to perform the sorting. It works by partitioning the array into a sorted and an unsorted part, in this case assuming that the sorted part takes place at the end of the array. It will then loop through the array comparing the next item with the current one, and swapping them in case the current item is greater than the next one, slowly moving the greatest elements to the end of the array. As soon as the first loop ends, the last index of the unsorted array is subtracted by one, and the next loop ends one element before this new index. By doing this, the overall performance is a little bit better. However, this algorithm still has a quadratic time-complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>), and degrades quick.
